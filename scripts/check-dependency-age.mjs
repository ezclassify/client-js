/**
 * Dependency quarantine gate.
 *
 * Refuses third-party packages that were published inside a quarantine window,
 * so a freshly compromised release has to sit on the registry for a while
 * before it can enter this repository's dependency tree.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT npm's `min-release-age` setting. That setting is
 * tree-wide with no way to exempt a scope, so putting it in a committed
 * `.npmrc` also quarantines our own first-party packages: a package published
 * minutes ago fails to install with ETARGET, which breaks the ordinary
 * cross-repository loop of publishing a library and refreshing its consumer.
 * The window belongs on third-party intake only, so the check lives here where
 * it can tell the two apart.
 *
 * Reads the lockfile rather than the manifests: the lockfile names the exact
 * versions that would be installed, including transitive ones, which is the set
 * that actually matters.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     node scripts/check-dependency-age.mjs [--days=N] [--lockfile=PATH] [--registry=URL]
 *     [--first-party-registry=URL,URL,...]
 *
 * Each flag also has an environment form, which is what the tests use:
 * `EZCLASSIFY_DEPENDENCY_AGE_DAYS`, `EZCLASSIFY_DEPENDENCY_AGE_LOCKFILE`,
 * `EZCLASSIFY_DEPENDENCY_AGE_REGISTRY` (the registry asked about an entry whose
 * lockfile record carries no `resolved` URL), and
 * `EZCLASSIFY_DEPENDENCY_AGE_FIRST_PARTY_REGISTRIES` (comma-separated origins
 * trusted to serve `@ezclassify/*`; see `resolveFirstPartyRegistries`).
