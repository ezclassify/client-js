# REST client reference

`@ezclassify/rest-client` connects a JavaScript application to an EzClassify
REST deployment. The server evaluates markings, guides, and access policies.
The client handles transport, response decoding, connection state, and caching.

## Generate and browse

After installing the repository's dependencies, run `npm run docs` and open
`docs/api/index.html`. The public reference starts at [`src/index.ts`](../src/index.ts) and follows
the client facade, operation classes, and inherited adapter methods. The
`client-ops` and `scheme-state` modules explain types reachable through client
properties; they are not supported package import subpaths. Shared request and result
types come from the public `@ezclassify/types` package.

`npm run docs:source` separately writes `docs/source/index.html` for maintained
source modules and scripts. Those exports include internal implementation
details; they are not additional supported npm import subpaths. Tests,
generated spec-version output, vendored specifications, build output, and
dependency trees are excluded. TypeDoc describes exported source symbols;
it does not document shell workflows or prove implementation behavior.

Both commands fetch pinned TypeDoc and TypeScript tools through npm when they
are not cached. Generated references stay local and are excluded from Git and
the npm tarball.

## Connect and dispose

Use `connectContext` or `EzClassifyClient.connect` to establish a ready client.
They return promises and perform connection work before resolving. The
constructor creates an unconnected client and performs no handshake or
heartbeat setup. Prefer the asynchronous entrypoints for a ready adapter. Call
`destroy()` when the host
is finished with it to stop monitoring and release cached state.

Connection arguments select a Context and may supply separate credentials:
`auth` identifies the caller, while `contextToken` authorizes the application
and Context binding. `connectContext` requires `contextId` and refuses a
connection without one before sending a request. Omit the version to let the
server choose: the Context token's default, or the newest published. A concrete
`contextVersion` pins the client to that version. It gives `auth` precedence
over the simpler `accessToken` argument. One `timeout` covers the
whole request, including the token suppliers, `onAuthFailure` and its single
replay, so caller code that never settles ends in `TIMEOUT`. See generated
option descriptions for token suppliers, refresh behavior, headers, deadlines,
and cancellation.

## Operation surfaces

| Surface          | Responsibility                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client.scheme`  | Marking processing, validation, aggregation, rendering, scanning, suggestions, and scheme descriptions           |
| `client.guide`   | Guide scanning, evaluation, rule descriptions, and guide views                                                   |
| `client.access`  | Access checks and access-policy descriptions                                                                     |
| `client.context` | Operations on the resolved composition, including document audits, access assessments, and crosswalk translation |

`EzClassifyClient` also satisfies `RemoteContextAdapter`, so consumers can use
its adapter methods directly. Public operations can reject with
`EzClassifyError`; inspect `code`, `status`, and the documented error fields.
A 429 response sets `retryAfter`, the seconds the server asked the caller to
wait.
`ErrorCodes` describes the codes the client raises itself: transport
failures, caller-input failures (`INVALID_INPUT`), and a 2xx response whose
body the contract does not allow (`MALFORMED_RESPONSE`), which is never
cached. Server responses can carry other codes, so `ErrorCode` is a string
rather than a closed enum. `isDenialShapedBody` recognizes the constant denial
body; it does not make an authorization decision.

## Caching and connection state

Caching and heartbeat monitoring are enabled by default. Access-decision caching
requires an explicit opt-in and a concrete Context version pin. A `latest` or
omitted version is mutable, so its entries expire: `cacheTtlMs` must be positive
and at most one hour, and the constructor refuses anything else. Entries under a
concrete version pin do not expire. Connection monitoring reports transport availability,
not permission to perform a particular operation. The generated reference
explains the circuit breaker, profile refresh, cache controls, and lifecycle
methods at their owning symbols.

See [the README](../README.md) for application examples and
[DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md) for native tests and conformance replay.
