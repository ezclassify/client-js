/**
 * `ValidationError` decode, held against a recorded engine answer.
 *
 * An error about a token the engine could not read may carry `didYouMean`: the
 * ids of the concepts the token was likely meant as. It is for a program to act
 * on, so the client has no business reshaping it. Like every other result
 * member it rides through as `@ezclassify/types` declares it, and this file
 * pins that with the one recorded answer that carries the member, rather than
 * with a payload written here to agree with the client.
 *
 * The recording is the conformance answer the runtime gave for validate on a
 * misspelled level. It is read from the vendored spec bundle, so a re-record
 * that drops or reshapes the member fails here instead of passing on a stale
 * copy.
